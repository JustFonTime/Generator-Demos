# What is This?

This tool can help developers that are integrated quest systems into their game but are unsure of where to get started or just want a quick visualization. 

The information stored for Quests are defaults that are stored in ScriptableObjects (see the folder) which can be changed if you have any baseline information of your own.

Generations from this tool are meant to create structured variability.
